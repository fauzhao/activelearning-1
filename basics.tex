Intro text. Talking about sigmoid. All here.

We assume a prior $\pi(w)$ where $w$ is a vector of parameters that describe our model.
We collect data $D$ by presenting a stimulus $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and observing a binary response $y \in \set{0, 1}$:
\begin{align}
	 D = \set{(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)} \equiv (X, Y)
\end{align}
