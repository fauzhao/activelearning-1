\section{Approximations} % (fold)
\label{sec:approximations}
We need to determine $K(x)$ for all $x$ values that we consider as worthwhile new stimuli. This can be many values and doing the involved integrals over posteriors is costly.
There are several ways to deal with this problem.

\subsection{Restricting the tested stimuli} % (fold)
\label{sub:restricting_the_tested_stimuli}
We need to discretize the $x$ anyways. We choose values.
